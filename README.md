This project contains a web application that allows a user to add their top (10) movies.
The application is comprised of front end and back end.
The front end contains HTML files and a CSS file.
These files contain HTML code and CSS styling that was provided by the Udemy course by Angela Wu.
The purpose of this project was to implement the back end of a web application with front end framework.
the modules used in this project are listed in the requirements.txt file.
Jinja 2 is used to build a dynamic front end and Flask WTF forms as well.
The back end uses SQL lite database to store the data.
Functinality:
The user adds a movie of their preference to the database by clicking on the add button.
The button takes the user a to a search page in which the user types keywords related to a movie.
Then the a list appears of movies containing the keywords with the date of release.
The movie data are collected from the The Movie Database website via API (user must create an account first)
Once the user clicks on the movie of their choice a new page appears in which the user rates the movie and 
add a review.
The movies appear on the home page in reverse order with the first movie having the lowest rank
and the last movie on the list having the highest.
